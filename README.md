Car Rental Backend (TypeScript + Express)

This repository contains the backend for a Car Rental Management System built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

The project follows a clean, layered architecture commonly used in real-world backend systems. It is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend as new features are added.

At the moment, the backend can run without a database connection. MongoDB integration can be enabled later when required.
